## Overview

This is a GUI based ASCII art creator.

## Dependencies

I generally try to minimize dependencies, but I'm a one man crew and can therefore only support Debian-based Linux
distributions as I'm running one myself. Anyway, you need to have the following packages installed for everything to
work properly:

- SDKMAN! for managing all the JVM dependencies. Install it via the [installation guide](https://sdkman.io/install).
- JDK for developing Java programs. Install it with `sdk install java`.
- Maven for building the whole thing. Install it with `sdk install maven`.

## How to use it

Build the JAR via `mvn clean compile assembly:single` and then run it
via `java -jar target/scrtcrtr-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.
